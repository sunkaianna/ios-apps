# iOS Apps 
Collection of iOS apps I made that use different sensors on the iPhone to do interesting tasks. 
There's an app that find the horizon line, which is a line formed by all vanishing points in that plane.
Also wrote a point tracker that uses the gyro data and device motion data to track position of an object when the camera is rotated about it's optical centre.
